I was preparing to take a jog today and looking at the sky I noticed that it defiantly looked like it was going to rain. So, I changed into my shorts, put in my headphones, and headed out regardless. As I ran, the rain poured over me, a slightly heavy drizzle, but nothing too bad. As I ran, I saw much fewer people out than I normally do. There was no one walking their dogs, there was no one running, I passed an empty park and basketball court, and finally I saw two younger men fishing in a small pond near my house. They didn’t seem to mind the rain too much, I mean it is just water. As I ran I saw the cars passing by, many more than normal willing to wait for me to cross the crosswalks, an appreciated gesture though they had to know I was out on my own will jogging. I began to think  about how people are so discouraged to do the things they like to do or want to do simply because of a little discomfort. If all it takes is a bit of water falling form the sky for so many people to skip their “workout routine”, then what else are they letting slip through because of a little bit of inconvenience. This reminded me of a pretty famous graduation speech I’ve listened to a few times. [Admiral William McRaven addresses the 2014 graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin] (https://youtu.be/pxBQLFLei70) with a speech about hard work, determination, and discipline, to name a few things. He spoke on the importance of the small successes you’ll find in life like maybe maintaining a clean house so when you get off work you don’t come home to a messy house. There is one line there that made it rounds around the internet, “If you want to change the world, start by making your bed”. This point makes sense. Not in the sense of changing the world, but in the sense of any task really. You have to have control of your life, you have to maintain the ability to be disciplined and to complete the most minuscule or seemingly pointless task before you can take on the challenge of something bigger. In my run in the rain, I thought, it doesn’t stop there. It can’t stop there. There are loads of people who have this discipline and control and not fulfilling their goal, though this should not be taken as disagreeing with him either. If you want to “change the world”, whether that be the world or maybe just your world, you have to start by making your bed. That isn’t enough though. This is just the starting point in larger plan. Like, I would guess, 99% of plans, things are not going to go….well as planned. There will be difficulties, there will be unexpected hurdles that pop up just as you likely feel they are at the worst timing. (I mean really though, when else would they come?) If you want to change the world, no matter what world that may be, you have to be willing to run in the rain. You have to be willing to do the things you don’t want to do even when they seem to be of little importance. Sure, you can skip that day, and you probably wouldn’t affect your half marathon goal time by any measurable amount.  But that may be feeding into a pattern, the pattern of I can do it tomorrow, I’m tired, I don’t want to, I don’t feel like it. While you still may be completing your goals, you could be very well selling yourself short. How bad do you want it, maybe to you it’s not worth getting wet, that’s fine and there’s no reason to run in the rain. At the same time, I can promise you one thing, if reaching new goals is your goal, if changing the world is what you set out to do, if you’re not out there running in the rain, someone else is. You may eventually find yourself sitting on the couch watching your idol on tv, as you glance over you see the rain coming down outside, and you wish to yourself that you could be them for just one minute, not realizing that the only thing holding you bad is a little bit of rain.
