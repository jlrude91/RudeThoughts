This evenings short article comes from two opposite sides of economics that happen to work their way into the crowded thoughts that already fill my head. The first one originates from my microeconomics class. The short explanation is that in economics, there are tools, measurements, and formulas available to discover patterns and make predictions. You can take something simple like any item in a grocery store and calculate its price elasticity* with elaborate formulas. The basic ones themselves can be pretty complicated, though it's just where it begins. With all the information that is available, all the calculations that are computed, sometimes hundreds of times per day, it could easily be assumed that economist and analyst are pretty close the mark in most of their estimates. Yes, while they are good at their jobs, there is one aspect that is completely out of their control. This data point, this observation, can throw all of those equations in the trash and completely overpower record sales, booming profits, and rising stocks. That would be the unpredictability of humans. This is something that I’ve always been aware of, but never had I seen it play out before like i did last week. There is a podcast that I watch/listen to called the [Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE). Many people are already aware in one way or another of who J. Rogan is. He was the host of Fear Factor for a while, he is huge in the UFC, he is an avid hunter and supporter of the outdoors, and for a while now he’s been running this YouTube channel/podcast. Last week he had Elon Musk on there. Like J. Rogan, E. Musk is a popular guy. If you didn’t already know, he is the founder/co-founder/CEO of companies like [Tesla] (https://www.tesla.com/) and [SpaceX] (https://www.spacex.com/). He is a very smart man who doesn’t just run the business but is a contributing engineer in the businesses and respective fields of science necessary for car building and space exploration. Last week while on the Joe Rogan podcast, J. Rogan was smoking a legal marijuana cigar like object. E. Musk, after assuring it was legal for the state he was in, took one puff of the cigar, you can [watch the interview here](https://youtu.be/ycPr5-27vSI) with the smoking event happening at about the 2:10:00 mark. While there were some other events happening inside Tesla at the time, they were not that detrimental to the value of the company’s stock. This event may have pushed Tesla over the edge. While there is no guarantee that E. Musk smoking the marijuana cigar was the cause, for the rest of the day after this event the stock price plummeted. Also, soon after this event, some high-level executives quit, possibly in response to E. Musk smoking. It didn’t go so far that it would compromise the company, but it did drop about 10% very fast, I believe it was, while finishing out the day at close to 7% under where it started. It is events like these that make economics so interesting. In the normal everyday passing of time and life, we can pretty well guess what is going to happen and make pretty good predictions about the future. Every once in a while, we get these wild, nearly unpredictable events that throw everything into immediate chaos and panic. The unpredictability of humans is something that I don’t believe we will ever have an equation for. As economists, its our job to take the equations, the predictions, evaluate the history and trends, and mix those with human behavior. We mix the two into a could of some-certainty, and help people, businesses, and even countries, make decisions about how to take on and be prepared for the ever changing economy.

\*Price elasticity of a product is basically how much a change in the price of a product effects the demand for it. For instance, if gas goes up 25% in cost (roughly $.75), then people are still very likely to consume the same amount of it. While if the iPhone went up 25% (roughly $250) its more likely than gas for the sales to drop and people find an alternative. How much you need the product, how many alternatives there are, and much more goes into the price elasticity of a product.
