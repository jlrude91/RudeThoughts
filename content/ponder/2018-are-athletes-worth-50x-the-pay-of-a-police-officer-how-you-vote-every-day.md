Athletes, actors, celebrities, all have one very big thing in common. The ones in the limelight, the ones that make it big and even many that aren’t huge but become decently successful, make a lot of money. There are many debates about whether these people deserve more money in year than many people will make in their lifetimes. At first this seems like the topic of a great debate. Why would these people get all this money? All they do is play sports or have a reality TV show. Seems like a pretty easy life, right? Once the dust settles, and both sides are finished making their arguments about how no one needs this money, or maybe they deserve it because they are the elite that on average only work for a few years so really their lifetime earnings aren’t that great, it is important to remember one important thing. They aren’t paid by the government, they aren’t paid by some magical entity that grants them money for their talents. They are paid by you and me. Every time you buy that sports cable package, that jersey, those shoes, you are paying them. They make the enormous amounts of money they make because the supply of them is one (one team, one specific player) and them demand for the is extremely high. How many people love Tim Brady, how many people think the New York Yankees are the best baseball team to exit? Our society praises and worships sports and the people that play them. The money spent on these teams and players allows for the salaries they earn. Its literally that simple. It doesn’t matter whether you think they deserve it or not, the teams get the money, so they allocate it in a way that they believe will bring them the best chance for success. Which Brings me to the secondary title. Every day when you spend your money, you are making a vote. It is likely a more impactful vote than any presidential or political vote you’ve ever made or ever will. When you spend a dollar, you are saying this item, this service, is more valuable/important than any other aspect of my life right now. You may think “well, a few drinks with the guys isn’t more important than my family.” Which is why I stated its at that time. It is likely if you’re out with your buddies, you’ve already paid your bills and filled your ridge. The statement still stands though. Often, you’ll hear people complain that soldiers who give their lives for our country make less than athletes who just play ball in our free country.  Idolize and praise those soldiers, firefighters, police officers, like you do athletes and maybe you’d see a change. Name a soldier from each branch and his stats, when was the last time you wore jersey representing the united states army or fire/ems? Quite the opposite happens in this realm of life; more is demanded, while these men and women are argued and fought with and then when asking for a tax raise for better equipment and pay it gets voted down without a second thought. When you spend your money, you are casting a vote. You are shifting the market, you are supporting a sector, you are fighting for your wants and needs. As to what’s been discussed today, is the want of your favorite football team to win greater than your want for your house to not burn down, to not be broken into, our countries freedom?
