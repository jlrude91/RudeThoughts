The title of this article implies a bit that I am for, or support, the voluntary stance stores have been recently taking in the wake of the Florida shooting. My initial reaction is this is absurd. We do not do this in any other market in America. For many years, there have been tens of thousands of deaths caused by drunk drivers. We don’t ban the cars or alcohol. We don’t go to alcohol suppliers and try to hold them accountable, or go to car manufactures and complain to them. We don’t get upset at lobbies fighting to keep the price of aluminum low or access to fresh clean water for their plant so that their prices can stay low and allow “access to alcohol.”. Many will say “Well, they’re not killing children,” and you’re right. They’re killing entire families and leaving many permanently injured. This true point behind this argument is that there is no consistency. That goes for being an adult in America as well. You can join the military, buy a rifle, and smoke at 18. But to drink or buy a hand gun, oh no, you must be 21. I’m not necessarily for or against adult privileges being granted at 18 or 21, in hindsight now that I’ve passed both of those ages, it wouldn’t really have made a difference to me at least. I just think that maybe we should be a little more consistent on our social arguments, and in legislation. Now that you’re finished laughing at reading that last sentence as it seems more likely that we’ll befriend North Korea before that happens, ill address that little voice in the back of your head saying “what in the world is that title all about?” Say that all retail superstores stopped selling guns to those under 21. The assault rifle thing doesn’t really matter because you can buy a different looking gun that shoots the same exact way, and it surprises me that these stores that sell guns can’t come to that conclusion on their own. The only way that you can now buy a gun is private suppliers and actual gun stores. One possible outcome from the actions of these stores is that more people go to local gun shops. If you have no gun knowledge I believe that is the most likely place that you would go. The stores already have their regulars, maybe they’ll convince more of their friends to come here. The point is, it is very likely that local gun stores will see more business. Why is this a good thing. Local gun stores often offer much more information and resources that retail stores do not. They usually offer decent shooting ranges, they can make better recommendations and build a better relationship with individual customers. They often have more on the sight training and access to knowledge. Access to courses with the ability to pitch these benefits to their customers. If we can get more people around the most knowledgeable gun people and pair that with access to appropriate training and resources, maybe this will actually work and redirect the already strong gun culture in America that provides overall benefits. For those that will come back with, well what if they just go buy form private sellers or gun shows. I believe it is unlikely a first-time gun buyer, or uneducated gun buyer, or someone who has bought guns’ from retail stores their entire life will switch to the private gun seller. It’s completely possible, and I may be wrong. I still stand by my point that only good will come from getting more people into local gun shops where they have access to the resources not available at retail stores.
