Welcome, and thank you for coming to check out our page at RudeThoughts!  RudeThoughts has one very big goal in mind, we want to spread conservative and libertarian concepts and ideas through discussion and facts. There will be heavier areas of focus, and probably topics we end up missing completely. This will likely also expand and shrink as the page grows and changes to subscribers wants and general age progression. Right now, our topic goals are relatively simple; economics, public policy, and social issues, with the focus on economics. We will discuss our real-world experience, research, and education in these areas to clarify and simplify what can seem like confusing and mentally overwhelming issues. Again we thank you, and we hope that you enjoy our page and continue to come back!
The entire process began when, after weeks of deliberation, I proposed the idea to a cp-worker. I was looking for a supplemental source to parallel my education goals. Currently only holding a B.S. in geography and remote sensing, I currently am waiting on my reply to graduate school. If accepted, I will be studying social and applied economics. Though my education is not developed to my desires, I am getting there. I completed many economic undergrad classes and always planned on going to graduate school to pursue economics. I am also a failed business owner; owner, operator, manager, mechanic, repossessee, and more at Fresh Start Automotive, a failed buy-here-pay-here used car lot located in Springfield, OH. My father has worked for himself his entire life owning many businesses including a wall paper business, rental properties, and a used car lot. My real world experience and education set the building blocks for a formal educational skyscraper. I hope I can use these in conjunction to provide insights into the page, focusing mainly on economics and policy, though I will likely dive into social issues as well. Youâ€™ll see the majority of content is created by myself, Jerry Rude (where we get the name from). But you may also see work and Ideas contributed from my co-worker, Eric Hamilton.
