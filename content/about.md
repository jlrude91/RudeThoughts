Welcome, and thank you for coming to check out my page, RudeThoughts.com!  RudeThoughts has one very big goal in mind, I want to spread conservative and libertarian concepts and ideas through discussion and facts. There will be heavier areas of focus, and probably topics I end up missing completely. This will likely also expand and shrink as the page grows and changes to subscribers wants and general progression. Right now, the topics likely to be covered are relatively simple; economics, public policy, and social issues, with the focus on economics. I will discuss my real-world experience, research, and education in these areas to clarify and simplify what can seem like confusing and mentally overwhelming issues. Again I thank you, and I hope that you enjoy my page and continue to come back!

The entire process began when, after weeks of deliberation, I proposed the idea to a co-worker. I was looking for a supplemental source to parallel my education goals. Currently only holding a B.S. in geography and remote sensing, I currently attend graduate school and am obtaining my Masters of Science in Social and Applied Economics. Though my education is not developed to my desires, I am getting there. I completed many economic undergrad classes and always planned on going to graduate school to pursue economics. I am also a failed business owner; owner, operator, manager, mechanic, repossessee, and more, at Fresh Start Automotive. This was a buy-here-pay-here used car lot located in Springfield, OH that I owned and operated. My father has worked for himself his entire life owning many businesses including a wallpaper business, rental properties, and a used car lot. My real world experience and education set the building blocks for a formal educational skyscraper. I hope I can use this cumulative knowledge to provide insights into the page, focusing mainly on economics and policy, though I will likely dive into social issues as well. Again thank you for visiting, enjoy!
