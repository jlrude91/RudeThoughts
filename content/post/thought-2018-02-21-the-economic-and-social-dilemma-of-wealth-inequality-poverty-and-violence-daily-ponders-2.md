Today I will discuss a dilemma that exists between economics, social issues, morals, and wealth inequality/poverty. The provocateur is Dr. Jordan Peterson, and the YouTube video link will be provided below. Here is the dilemma; according to Dr. Peterson, research indicates that relative poverty and social violence strongly correlate. This idea behind this is that jealousy, greed, anger, and a feeling that the wealthy have something you can never achieve is the root of the violence. A very important aspect of his argument is the word relative. This means that is you had two societies  where the wealth inequality was 1 million dollars, but one was $0-$1,000,000 and the other was $100,000-$1,100,000 and both had the same levels of poverty (the dollar amount at the poverty line would obviously be different) they would theoretically have the same violence issues because the relative inequality in each is the same (this is just a very simple and quick way to explain it, but it truly exists outside of actual dollars). When researchers prove statistically that the poorest people in America live well above the world poverty line, that fact does not matter. Inequality is a closed system that resides within individual economies. There is a pretty simple solution to this, close the inequality to the point where the poorest don't believe that the wealthiest achievements are outside of their capabilities. This is where the argument takes a turn, and its validity far outweighs potential socialism. First, it is important to understand the cost of something. When you work, the cost of your labor is normally valued in dollars, but the true cost is your time. The time you spent out of your life that you will never get back is taxed and a true immoral act has taken place. That section of your existence has been taken from you to be given to another person at their benefit at the cost of your time and the work you filled it with. There is an argument to be made that the existence of a better society is the benefit you receive, but is it worth what has been taken? Jordan Peterson discusses two phenomenon that exist, almost as laws in regards to labor and wealth. Prices law states that the square root of employees in a labor pool complete 50% of the work. For 10 employees, that's 3 people. But for 100 employees, that's 10 people. Then there is the famous 1%. An interesting fact though, is that in human creativity and production there is always a 1% that produces significantly more than the opposing 99%. Number of records produced, number of goals scored in a sporting event, size of cities, and more. There is a 1% in each of those categories and every other category of creative human production, but we do not subsidize those differences down to the less productive. What does all this mean? Maybe it means that we have two options. Allow the existence of a free market and personal ownership of production but at the cost of potentially more violence. Or steal peoples time, something they cannot ever get back, in the attempts to lower social violence while at the same time resisting the natural market (I hope to be writing an article on the natural market soon if you're interested). If these "laws" are in fact true then it does not matter what you do, in America at least, 18165 ( based on current population of about 330 million, and if I used the actual working force that number would be even smaller) people are going to produce 50% of the economy. Also there will always be a 1% of the best creators. Are our efforts to reach utopian level equality inevitably futile?
