Today I am starting what I hope to be a regular week day post called Daily Ponders. These are just my unscripted, unedited thoughts. I will write them on my lunch break while I eat, somewhat like a journal entry, trying to keep them short and allow you as the reader to catch a glimpse of what I am thinking about as I work through my every day life and find my way to specific topics. If you enjoy these please let me know with a like, share, or comment, thanks!

Republicans will win the day. I was listening to Peter Schiff, as I do at some point in time every day, and he was talking about how President Trump will likely serve only one term. The idea behind this is that America is an economic disaster. The republicans and democrats are at each others throats because we criticize opposing budget deals, deficits, and policy while completely disregarding our own that has the same fiscal impacts. Currently President Trump is serving the American people a glass of Jonestown kool-aid by cutting taxes and increasing spending after dealing a burdening blow to The Affordable care by keeping its program in place but removing mandatory participation. (It should've been an all in or all out decision) This will lead to the economic crisis wave magnifying (as both him and I agree that our economy hasn't recovered from the .com bubble of the late 90's) from either more simulation or an immediate crash in the dollar. He will be voted out of office to what is likely to be a socialist democrat. The cycle will continue as the democrat continues to spend and a republican promising to cut spending and lower the deficit is elected, but then goes back on their promises and keep that spending engine running. This had me thinking, if all politicians are doing the same thing, whoever gets in there first and is willing to pull the e-brake and stop this wreck will eventually win the war despite how many battles are fought. This only leaves one option, republicans, but it'll take a little help. As control continues to switch in the capital, right now both sides are spending, spending, spending. Assuming democrats continue their trend and move closer to socialism, they never come in and make America feel the pain from this ever growing economic tragedy. They'll continue to blow up the balloon while pointing the finger at previous republic policy. This will not stop until a fiscally conservative politician stops the buck, likely at his own detriment as there will be a crash, likely of great magnitude. If republicans can team up with libertarians to form a more unified alliance, it may be possible for this situation to work out where possibly,yes the republican in power would be voted out, but a different libertarian-republican fusion candidate can get in to maintain policy. This may take a very long time, but we know what democrats will continue to do, so there are two outcomes, socialism which I doubt would ever actually go full scale, leaving only the last. A sacrificial republican followed by libertarian-conservative party fusion white house control. 

Again everyone, these are my thoughts that run through my head as I think throughout the day, unedited, unscripted. Look into my more comprehensive, thought out, and structured full length articles that may dissect these ideas and explain why I still stand with them or why I may have changed my mind.
